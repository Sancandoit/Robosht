# Bosch Changsha â€“ DSN Demo (Digital Twin + GenAI Maintenance Assistant)

Two Streamlit apps aligned to the Bosch Changsha case and our TDSC learnings:
- **Digital Twin**: What-if scheduling simulator for an engine test line (throughput, energy, overrun risk)
- **GenAI Maintenance Assistant**: Interprets logs and sensor signals to propose actions (OpenAI optional)

## Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
